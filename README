The work on actual rewrite engine had not been started yet.

The code depends on the cl-yacc, cl-lex and cl-ppcre.
The Quicklisp is used to track dependencies, see the next page for details:
  http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/

There is a not tested probability that quicklisp would load all dependencies by itself,
in case if this is not true, manual installation looks like:
  (ql:quickload "yacc")
  (ql:quickload "cl-lex")
  (ql:quickload "optima")

To run the project issue:
  sbcl --script init.lisp 2>&1 | less

Currently it prints info on macro expansions and a result of running of very small test.
